4 Pillars of OOP

1. Encapsulation
To create a class and use Attributes, Contructors, Getters/Setters.

2. Abstraction 
Creating methods that a user can use, without knowing the source code.
Being able to use a program and not know every little detail of the program. Using documentation to show how to use it. Think of how a user doesn't know how to deposit money but can easily do it.


3. Inheritance 
Passing attributes to child classes 

4. Polymorphism
Changing methods on a child class that they inherited from the Super class
